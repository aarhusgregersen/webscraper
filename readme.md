Sample webscraper project I've built to get a feel for what webscraping is like.

This project has been built with no automated/mechanized scraping so it only runs whenever a user runs it.

It pulls the titles from the pets section of craigslist newyork as well as the current Trustpilot rating of the company I am currently employed at.
